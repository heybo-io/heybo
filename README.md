Welcome to the world of Heybo!  

Heybo is the software platform for the Do-it-yourself IOT device, Kobo.  It is a full fledged voice activated Internet-of-things (IOT) device for managing your home, ordering goods, and now, with your heybo-dev platform help, literally anything you want.  


Getting set up

If you are just getting started, you can check out the course on Kobo located at {insert udemy course here}.  There is a short tutorial about the hardware you need, how to assemble it, and how to get started with installing everything.  You can also read through the guide located here. 

First, install Raspberrian on your raspberry pi 2 or 3.  


You can find a guide for doing this here:
(https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/) 

or if you hate reading, here:

The purpose of this readme is to give you an idea about the contents of this repo.  Heybo has been primarily written in Python but any submissions or ports into other languages are both welcome and desired.
